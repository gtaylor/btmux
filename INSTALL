========================================

 S1: BUILD DEPENDENCIES
 ----------------------
 Before you even attempt to compile the source, you'll need to make sure that
 your machine has the following packages installed:

 * crypt (libcrypt/lcrypt)
 * libevent (http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/)
 * libdbi (If SQL support is enabled)
 * autoconf
 * Subversion (If you didn't download a complete packaged BTMux)

 S2: COMPILING AND RUNNING THE SOURCE
 ------------------------------------
 To compile the Battletech MUX source, 'cd' into your root BTMux dir and type
 './configure'. If you downloaded the Subversion trunk, you'll need to do
 a 'make -f Makefile.dist' prior to that.

 NOTE: If you'd like to change the default configuration values, issue a
 './configure --help' to see the various features that may be enabled or
 disabled. More about this in Section 5. When you've got your configuration
 how you like it, proceed with compiling the source by typing './configure'
 followed by any flags you need, then 'make install'.

 Make sure that you already have a /game directory present or the binaries
 won't be moved and you will not have a working game. See Sections 1 and 2
 for details on setting your game directory up. In general, 'make install'
 will pull the latest version of everything you need as long as you
 have Subversion installed.

 To run the example database, cd into the /game.run directory after running
 'make install', and run './Startmux'. Also see the README in the 'game'
 directory.

 A quick note on the 'game' directory: For those of you who have used
 older versions of BTMux source, the /game directory is not where the
 actual game directory you want to run is. When you 'make install',
 the script checks to see if there is a /game.run present. If there
 isn't, it copies /game to /game.run. This is done so you have a template
 (/game) and a working copy (/game.run). Once you have a /game.run, you
 may safely delete /game if you so wish.

 S3: COMPILE-TIME DIRECTIVES
 ---------------------------
 There are a number of compile-time directives available for you to further
 customize your game to your tastes. You may view these at:

 http://docs.btmux.com/index.php/Compile_Time_Options

 You may set these by issuing a './configure' with the needed flags. See
 './configure --help' for an up-to-date list.

 Most of these require a 'make clean' before re-compiling. Some may also
 require a hcode.db rebuild which means you'll need to remove your
 /game/hcode.db file and setup all of your xcode objects again.

 S4: GAME CONFIGURATION FILE
 ---------------------------
 If you look under /game.run, you'll see some file with a .conf extension.
 This is generally netmux.conf if you are using BTMux in a Box. You'll 
 need to look through this file and change whichever options you want. 
 Most importantly, change the 'port' config directive as you will most 
 likely want to choose something unique. Documentation on config 
 directives may be found at:

 http://docs.btmux.com/index.php/Config_Directives

 Note that you'll need to do a @restart for most of these config
 directives to take effect. You may use the @admin command with your
 #1 character to do most of these but anything set by @admin won't
 be saved across restarts unless it's also in your <gamename>.conf
 file.

 S5: STARTING AND CONNECTING TO YOUR GAME
 ----------------------------------------
 Once your game is compiled and your game.run directory is populated,
 cd to game.run and type:

 ./Startmux &

 This will kick off your MUX. You should see 'netmux' and a few other
 processes related to the game under the Linux/Unix command, 'ps'.
 Try connecting to the port you specified in netmux.conf and see if
 you are greeted with a connection screen.

 IMPORTANT: The default wiz characters both have the same password:

 btmuxr0x

 You may connect with the #1 character (The god character, only use
 it when you have to change config directives or @set other players
 WIZARD) and the #2 character (Your new head wiz character). 

 You may connect using the two character's dbref like this:

 connect #1 btmuxr0x

 Note that the same password is used for both #1 and #2, you will
 need to change these using the @password command as soon as
 possible! 

 You should now be set to start tinkering! Good luck :)

 S6: GETTING FURTHER HELP
 ------------------------
 For more information on the support available to you, check out the
 SUPPORT file included in your root BTMux directory. This lists
 all of the resources available.
