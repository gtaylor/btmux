========================================

S1: BUILD DEPENDENCIES
----------------------
Before you even attempt to compile the source, you'll need to make sure that
your machine has the following packages installed:

* crypt (libcrypt/lcrypt)
* libevent (http://www.monkey.org/~provos/libevent/)
* libdbi (If SQL support is enabled)
* autoconf

 S2: OBTAINING THE NEEDED MODULES
 --------------------------------
 BattletechMUX comes in a set of modules that allow for certain chunks of the
 structure to be updated or inter-changed with other alternative versions.
 This is markedly different from the older versions of BTMux where everything
 came in one package.

 The first thing you need to get is the actual BTMux source. This serves as
 the root directory for the entire tree and is where you bring in the
 modules that you download. 

 You have two methods of obtaining the BTMux source: 
 * Subversion
 * SourceForge Files Page

 The Subversion source will be the latest and most up to date, but may have
 bugs in it. The releases are more stable and tested, but may not have bug
 fixes or improvements in them that the Subversion source does have. So,
 choose your poison and see one of the following sections.

 S2A: SUBVERSION SOURCE
 ----------------------
 See the instructions on:
  http://docs.btmux.com/index.php/Getting_and_Updating_the_Source

 S2B: SOURCEFORGE RELEASE
 ------------------------
 Head on over to the btonline-btmux project's
 Files section at:
 
 http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=128056
 
 First download a version of the source. This is under the Btech-Online BTMux
 package. Select the version you'd like (usually the latest) and download
 it to your home directory. Un-tar/bzip it like this:
 
 tar -jxf btonline-btechmux-0.x.tbz2
 
 Make sure to replace the 'x' with the proper version number. This will leave
 you with a btonline-btechmux directory. We'll call this your BTMux root dir.

 Next you'll want to download a game directory. If you are new to running
 BTMuxs, it is strongly recommended you get the BattletechMUX in a Box
 game dir. This contains a lot of BTMux systems pre-built so you can get
 right to working on the fun stuff. Download it and extract it like before
 but make sure you're in the directory the BTMux root dir occupies (not
 from within the actual BTMux root dir).

 You will then want to download a Map, Mech, and Text directory. If you
 don't know which one to get, stick with the standard ones. Extract all
 of these just like you did with the source and make sure to do it from
 the same directory.

S3: BTMUX DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
-----------------------------
You should now have a full BTMux tree filled out. Here is what the structure
of a BTMux looks like as far as the modules you downloaded go:

btonline-btechmux
|- src
|- game
  |- maps
  |- mechs
  |- text

Note that there are a lot more directories and files than those listed above
but that's where each of the modules belong.

S4: COMPILING AND RUNNING THE SOURCE
------------------------------------
To compile the Battletech MUX source, 'cd' into your root BTMux dir and type
'make -f Makefile.dist'. This will generate a configure script and run it
with the defaults.

NOTE: If you'd like to change the default configuration values, issue a
'./configure --help' to see the various features that may be enabled or
disabled. More about this in Section 5. When you've got your configuration
how you like it, proceed with compiling the source by typing './configure'
followed by any flags you need, then 'make install'.

Make sure that you already have a /game directory present or the binaries
won't be moved and you will not have a working game. See Sections 1 and 2
for details on setting your game directory up. In general, 'make install'
will pull the latest version of everything you need as long as you
have Subversion installed.

To run the example database, cd into the /game.run directory after running
'make install', and run './Startmux'. Also see the README in the 'game'
directory.

A quick note on the 'game' directory: For those of you who have used
older versions of BTMux source, the /game directory is not where the
actual game directory you want to run is. When you 'make install',
the script checks to see if there is a /game.run present. If there
isn't, it copies /game to /game.run. This is done so you have a template
(/game) and a working copy (/game.run). Once you have a /game.run, you
may safely delete /game if you so wish.

S5: COMPILE-TIME DIRECTIVES
---------------------------
There are a number of compile-time directives available for you to further
customize your game to your tastes. You may view these at:

http://docs.btmux.com/index.php/Compile_Time_Options

You may set these by issuing a './configure' with the needed flags. See
'./configure --help' for an up-to-date list.

Most of these require a 'make clean' before re-compiling. Some may also
require a hcode.db rebuild which means you'll need to remove your
/game/hcode.db file and setup all of your xcode objects again.

S6: GAME CONFIGURATION FILE
---------------------------
If you look under /game.run, you'll see some file with a .conf extension.
This is generally netmux.conf if you are using BTMux in a Box. You'll 
need to look through this file and change whichever options you want. 
Most importantly, change the 'port' config directive as you will most 
likely want to choose something unique. Documentation on config 
directives may be found at:

http://docs.btmux.com/index.php/Config_Directives

Note that you'll need to do a @restart for most of these config
directives to take effect. You may use the @admin command with your
#1 character to do most of these but anything set by @admin won't
be saved across restarts unless it's also in your <gamename>.conf
file.

S7: STARTING AND CONNECTING TO YOUR GAME
----------------------------------------
Once your game is compiled and your game.run directory is populated,
cd to game.run and type:

./Startmux &

This will kick off your MUX. You should see 'netmux' and a few other
processes related to the game under the Linux/Unix command, 'ps'.
Try connecting to the port you specified in netmux.conf and see if
you are greeted with a connection screen.

IMPORTANT: The default wiz characters both have the same password:

btmuxr0x

You may connect with the #1 character (The god character, only use
it when you have to change config directives or @set other players
WIZARD) and the #2 character (Your new head wiz character). 

You may connect using the two character's dbref like this:

connect #1 btmuxr0x

Note that the same password is used for both #1 and #2, you will
need to change these using the @password command as soon as
possible! 

You should now be set to start tinkering! Good luck :)

S8: GETTING FURTHER HELP
------------------------
For more information on the support available to you, check out the
SUPPORT file included in your root BTMux directory. This lists
all of the resources available.
